# ReactDine
This is a project made in a web dev course
The app is deployed using Microsoft Azure and Render but
it is deployed from a different repository, but I kept the
Azure workflows here too. The app runs in the following url
(NOTE: if the page hasn't been visited for a while, the backend
shuts itself down since I'm using a free service. Wait for a minute
and it should boot itself back up. You'll know when it is up 
when the menu has loaded and a video starts playing in the background
of the front page!)
